do people decide whether or not to read a tweet?</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>November 4, 2014</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>It turns out that an existing relationship with the author of the tweet is one of the main factors influencing how someone decides whether or not to read a tweet. At the same time,  a large number associated with a tweet can also make the tweet more attractive to readers.</p><p>Our <a href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581914001268>latest Open Access research</a> has discovered how much effect the information about a tweet has on whether people decide to read it or not.</p><p>By showing hundreds of Twitter users the information about two tweets but not the tweets themselves, and then asking the users which tweet they would like to read, we have been able to look at which information is more important when users are deciding to read a tweet.</p><p>We looked at two different types of information:</p><ol><li><p>Simple numbers that describe the tweet, such as the number of retweets it has, or numbers that describe the author, such as how many followers they have, or how many tweets they’ve written.</p></li><li><p>Whether a relationship between the reader and the author is important, and whether that relationship was best shown through subtle hints, or direct information.</p></li></ol><p>When readers can see only one piece of information, the case is clear: they’d <strong>rather read the tweet written by someone they are following</strong>. Readers can easily recognise the usernames, names, and profile images of people they already follow, and are likely to choose to read content written by someone they follow (instead of content written by a stranger) around 75% of the time. If all they can see is a piece of numerical information, they would <strong>rather read the tweet with the highest number</strong>, no matter what that number is. The effect is strongest with the number of retweets, followed by the number of followers, but even for the number of following and number of tweets written the effect is significant.</p><p>When readers can see two pieces of information, one about their relationship with the author, and one numerical, there are two cases to look at. When the author they follow also has a high numerical value, readers will choose that tweet in around 80% of the cases. When the author they already follow has a lower numerical value, it is still the existing relationship that is more of a draw. <strong>Readers would rather read a tweet from someone they know that has a low number of retweets, than one from a stranger with a high number of retweets.</strong></p><p>This work offers an understanding of how the decision-making process works on Twitter when users are skimming their timelines for something to read, and has particular implications for the display and promotion of non-timeline content within content streams. For instance, readers may pay more attention to adverts and promoted content if the link between themselves and the author is highlighted.</p><p><a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6406256">Previous results</a>  from an early experiment were published at <a href=http://martinchorley.co.uk/2012/09/07/socialcom-2012/ >SocialCom</a>.

It is patchy, it is more than often unkempt, and it is quite ginger, but it is somewhat beard like. I can no longer remember when I grew this beard, but I like it. I like it so much that I refused to shave it off when I graduated in 2013, and again when I got married earlier this year.</p><p>However, ominous things have happened. Recently, a mate and colleague done a tweet:</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet data-lang=en><p lang=en dir=ltr>I beat testicular cancer this year. To contribute to research I&#39;m supporting <a href=https://twitter.com/MovemberUK>@MovemberUK</a> - join the team <a href=http://t.co/7mtTE7kVmD>http://t.co/7mtTE7kVmD</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/cardiffuni>@cardiffuni</a></p>&mdash; Pete Burnap (@pbFeed) <a href=https://twitter.com/pbFeed/status/524291166615789570>October 20, 2014</a></blockquote><p>“Good on Pete” I thought. Good cause. I did Movember back in 2011, and it was hard, because quite frankly with a moustache I look like a complete tit. At the time I was doing it, I think Pete and I were sharing an office, so he knows how much of a tit you can look like during Movember, yet he’s chosen to do it anyway. Well done.</p><p>Of course, you won’t catch me doing it. I have a beard now, and I won’t shave that off. Also, as I mentioned, I look like a complete tit when I grow a moustache. It was fine in 2011, I was only an RA, so I could just hide in the office and work. The only person affected was my wife, who sadly had to be seen in public with me. I’m a lecturer now. I can’t just hide in my office. I have to teach. I have to stand up in front of students. I can’t do that looking like a person who belongs on some sort of list.</p><p>Then Vince Knight joined Pete’s team:</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet data-lang=en><p lang=en dir=ltr>I am now apparently putting my facial hair to the test and have joined <a href=https://twitter.com/pbFeed>@pbFeed</a> for <a href=https://twitter.com/MovemberUK>@MovemberUK</a>. My page is here: <a href=http://t.co/IswbUL7sEG>http://t.co/IswbUL7sEG</a></p>&mdash; Vincent Knight 📎 (@drvinceknight) <a href=https://twitter.com/drvinceknight/status/524532773080805376>October 21, 2014</a></blockquote><p>“Well done Vince” I thought. Good cause. At least Pete won’t look so daft walking around campus with a ‘tache now. There’ll be two of you at least. Not me of course. No way.</p><p>Then Pete done another tweet:</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet data-lang=en><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=https://twitter.com/drvinceknight>@drvinceknight</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/MovemberUK>@MovemberUK</a> Yeah you have!!! <a href=https://twitter.com/voxmjw>@voxmjw</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/martinjc>@martinjc</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/walter_colombo1>@walter_colombo1</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/MattLWilliams>@MattLWilliams</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/docjaq>@docjaq</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/flyingSparx>@flyingSparx</a> Get involved!!</p>&mdash; Pete Burnap (@pbFeed) <a href=https://twitter.com/pbFeed/status/524533385847664640>October 21, 2014</a></blockquote><p>Oh.</p><p>Pete’s called me out. He wants me to join in. Maybe we’ll just all ignore him and it’ll go away.</p><p>Then I done a tweet:</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet data-lang=en><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=https://twitter.com/pbFeed>@pbFeed</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/drvinceknight>@drvinceknight</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/voxmjw>@voxmjw</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/walter_colombo1>@walter_colombo1</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/MattLWilliams>@MattLWilliams</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/docjaq>@docjaq</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/flyingSparx>@flyingSparx</a> hard to say no, I did look fabulous last time.</p>&mdash; Martin Chorley (@martinjc) <a href=https://twitter.com/martinjc/status/524538880939544576>October 21, 2014</a></blockquote><p>WTF? What did I just do? Did I agree to do Movember again? Why? I have no idea. Perhaps I enjoy looking like a tit?</p><p>So. I joined. As did many others that Pete called out. And now we’re all going to grow moustaches and demand money from our friends, relatives and colleagues. It’s a good cause. You can donate to us, our team page is <a href=http://uk.movember.com/team/1637929>here</a>.</p><p>First though, there’s business to take care of. The beard had to go. I had to locate my shaving equipment, which has not been used in many years, and attempt to remove the lovely facial hair to which I have become so attached, without slicing my face apart in the process:</p><p><img src=http://martinchorley.co.uk/img/2014-11-01-beards-taches-and-testicles/beard_removal-1024x910.png alt="WHAT HAVE I DONE?"></p><p>So that’s it. The beard is off and I am clean-shaven for the first time in I don’t know how long. This, I think, is quite the sacrifice. But there is more to come. The ‘tache is on its way - slowly working its way out of my upper lip. I am going to look terrible. If you in any way feel inclined, please make it worth it. Donate to <a href=http://mobro.co/martinjc>me</a> or the <a href=http://moteam.co/cardiff-university>team</a>. Don’t let my beard have fallen in vain.  After all (I came up with this last night while very drunk and I LOVE IT):  beards grow back. Balls don’t.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/2014/10/03/computational-journalism-a-manifesto.html>Computational Journalism - 'a Manifesto'</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>October 3, 2014</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>While Glyn and I have been discussing the new MSc course between ourselves and with others, we have repeatedly come up with the same issues and themes, again and again.

I traced the conversation back to the beginning and found this request for data:</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet data-lang=en><p lang=en dir=ltr>I&#39;m looking for a dataset that shows which UK constituencies are in which NHS trust areas. Anyone?</p>&mdash; retired account (@retired10072015) <a href=https://twitter.com/retired10072015/status/511105946710716416>September 14, 2014</a></blockquote><script async src=//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js charset=utf-8></script><p>I’ve been doing a lot of playing with geographic data recently while preparing to release a site making it easier to get GeoJSON boundaries of various areas in the UK. As a result, I’ve become pretty familiar with the <a href=https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/geoportal/catalog/search/browse/browse.page>Office of National Statistics Geography portal</a>, and the data available there. I figured it must be pretty simple to hack something together to provide the data Joseph was looking for, so I took a few minutes out of lunch to see if I could help.</p><p>Checking the lookup tables at the ONS, it was clear that unfortunately there was no simple ‘NHS Trust to Parliamentary Constituency’ lookup table. However, there were two separate lookups involving Output Areas (OAs). One allows you to lookup <a href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/geoportal/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B441E0CBF-1421-4BF5-BBC9-5B7C0EA0FE44%7D">which Parliamentary Constituency (WPC) an OA belongs to</a>. The other allows you to lookup <a href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/geoportal/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B15C3A07F-F5E1-4CE8-9CFD-24B3589C725B%7D">which NHS Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) an OA belongs to</a>. Clearly, all that’s required to link the two together is a bit of quick scripting to tie them both together via the Output Areas.</p><p>First, let’s create a dictionary with an entry for each CCG. For each CCG we’ll store it’s ID, name, and a set of OAs contained within. We’ll also add  an empty set for the WPCs contained within the CCG:</p><figure class=highlight><pre><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span class=kn>import</span> <span class=nn>csv</span>
