href="http://www.ksri.kit.edu/Default.aspx?PageId=691&amp;lang=en">Simon Caton</a> to come to the <a href="http://www.ksri.kit.edu/Default.aspx?lang=en">KSRI</a> <a href=http://service-summer.ksri.kit.edu/62.php>Services Summer School</a>, held at <a href=http://www.kit.edu/index.php>KIT</a> in Germany, to help him run a workshop session on <a href=http://service-summer.ksri.kit.edu/104.php>Social Computing</a>.  We decided to use the session as a crash course in retrieving and manipulating data from Social Media APIs - showing the students the basics, then running a mini ‘hackathon’ for the students to gain some practical experience.</p><p>I think the session went really well, the students seemed to enjoy it and the feedback was very positive. We spent about 90 minutes talking about APIs, JSON, Twitter, Facebook and Foursquare, then set the students off on forming teams and brainstorming ideas. Very quickly they managed to get set up grabbing Twitter data from the streaming API, and coming up with ways of analysing it for interesting facts and statistics.  A number of the students were not coders, and had never done anything like this before, so it was great to see them diving in, setting up servers and running php scripts to grab the data. It was also good to see the level of team work on display; everyone was communicating, dividing the work, and getting on well. Fuelled by a combination of pizza, beer, red bull and haribo they coded into the night, until we drew things to a close at about 10pm and retired to the nearest bar for a pint of debrief.</p><p><img src=http://martinchorley.co.uk/img/2013-09-24-ksri-services-summer-school-social-computing-theory-and-hackathon/2013-09-23-18.03.23-1024x768.jpg alt="Hackathon Students"></p><p>It was a really good experience, and I think everyone got something useful out of it.

(It should be noted that the ‘IMAX” bit  doesn’t mean much -  the screen at the Odeon is <a href=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/14361/the-incredible-shrinking-imax-screen>nowhere near as big as a true ‘IMAX’ screen</a>). I should say, I love this film <em>a lot</em> - hence my willingness to pay £12 (£12!!??!) to see it again on the big screen. I first saw it in the Shrewsbury Empire cinema when I was 10 years old, in one of my first (and possibly only) trips to the cinema with my Dad, and instantly loved it. This is not entirely unsurprising considering I was essentially the target audience at the time. Following that I wore through a pirate VHS copy obtained from a friend, then an actual legitimate VHS copy, followed by the inevitable much hardier DVD purchase. When we finally embraced streaming media a couple of years ago and sold off all the DVDs it was one of only a few that I was desperate to keep. I like the movie so much that I can even forgive Jurassic Park 2 and 3.</p><p>It’s sad then for me to see the movie in this format now. From minute 1, it’s clear that the 3D conversion is very poor quality. It’s basically like watching a moving pop up book, as flat characters and objects make their way across the screen at varying depths. At some points individual characters have been picked out of the background so poorly it actually looks like they’ve been filmed with early green-screen effects, so they’re totally divorced from the background. It just doesn’t add anything to the movie, and is actually often distracting. It’s a waste of the already impressive visuals of the movie, and so easy to see it for what it is: a cheap gimmick to try and cash in on a successful property. The problem is that it’s totally unnecessary - all that’s needed to get a bunch of new film goers interested in Jurassic Park (and become the ready made audience for the next ‘new’ JP movie) is to release the film again. I’m sure it would have done just as well as a 2D re-release, so this poor 3D affair is a waste of effort.</p><p>Of course the film itself is still amazing, and the sound quality (whether due to this new version or because of the IMAX standard speaker system) absolutely blew me away. I heard lines of dialogue that were previously just characters muttering under their breath, and the roar of the dinosaurs combined with <em>that</em> John Williams theme made me forgive the awful awful 3d conversion and fall in love with the movie all over again.</p><p>Also the raptors are still bloody terrifying.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/2013/08/20/not-another-bloody-wordle.html>not another bloody wordle?!?!</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>August 20, 2013</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>(UPDATE: an earlier version of this was totally wrong. It’s better now.)</p><p>Inspired by a Facebook post from a colleague, I decided to waste ten minutes this week knocking together a word cloud from the text of my thesis. The process was pretty straightforward.</p><p>First up - extracting the text from the thesis. Like all good scienticians, my thesis was written in LaTeX. I thought I could have used a couple of different tools to extract the plain text from the raw .tex input files, but actually none of the tools available from a quick googling seemed to work properly, so I went with extracting the text from the pdf file instead. Fortunately on Mac OS X this is pretty simple, as you can create a straightforward Automator application to extract the text from any pdf file, as documented in step 2 <a href=http://craiccomputing.blogspot.co.uk/2010/11/extracting-text-from-pdf-documents-on.html>here</a>.</p><p>Once I had the plain text contents of my thesis in a text file it was just a simple few lines of python (using the excellent <a href=http://nltk.org/ >NLTK</a>) to get a frequency distribution of the words in my thesis:</p><figure class=highlight><pre><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span class=kn>from</span> <span class=nn>nltk.probability</span> <span class=kn>import</span> <span class=n>FreqDist</span>

This means I’ve been given an opportunity to spend 12 months from October this year working independently on a research project of my own choosing. I’ll be looking at the connection between places and personality, analysing the large dataset collected through the <a href=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/recognition/foursqexp/ >Foursquare Personality</a> app to try and build towards a recommendation system for places that uses personality as one of its key input signals.</p><p>I think this is a really interesting research project, and I’m hoping for some good results. The basic question I’m asking is: if we know where someone has been (i.e. from their Foursquare history) then can we predict what their personality is? If we can do that, then maybe we can do the reverse, and from someone’s personality, infer where they might like to go. This could lead to a shift in the way that place recommendation systems are built, utilising not just the knowledge of <em>where</em> someone has been, but also <em>why</em> someone has been there.</p><p>This is a great opportunity -  while it has been really good to work on the last two EU projects I’ve been involved in, the overheads (especially the deliverables) have sometimes been a distraction and have sometimes gotten in the way of the research. With this project I’ll be able to plough on with the research without having to worry about those kinds of administrative overheads. It’s also a great stepping stone on my academic career path, and should give me the opportunity to generate some high quality outputs that will help with moving on to the next stage.</p></div></article><hr><div class=pagination><a href=/blog/page6 class=previous>Previous</a> <span class=page_number>Page: 7 of 20</span> <a href=/blog/page8 class=next>Next</a></div></div></body></html>
