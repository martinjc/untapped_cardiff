class=content><p>Today we are finally starting to promote our latest experiment. It’s been online for about a month, but we haven’t told anyone about it while we’ve been finishing up the Year 2 deliverables for <a href=http://www.recognition-project.eu/ >Recognition</a> (the review is in a couple of weeks - fingers crossed!) Now however I can start publicly talking about it and encouraging people to take part and get involved!</p><p>We’re calling it the Foursquare Personality Experiment, and it’s available on the <a href=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/ >School of Computer Science &amp; Informatics</a>’ website <a href=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/recognition/foursqexp>here</a>:</p><p><a href=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/recognition/foursqexp>http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/recognition/foursqexp</a></p><p>It’s basically looking at comparing people’s <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCEAN_model_of_personality>five-factor OCEAN personality profiles</a> to the places that they check in to on <a href=http://www.foursquare.com>Foursquare</a>. So, you go along to the site, sign in with your Foursquare account and take a really <a href=http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~johnlab/bfi.htm>short 44-question personality test</a>. While you’re doing that, we retrieve the list of places you’ve been to from Foursquare. When it’s all done, we show you your personality, and how it compares to the average personality of people in your area (average personality comes from the <a href=http://mypersonality.org/research/ >mypersonality.org</a> data, thanks guys!). All the venues you’ve checked into on Foursquare are simultaneously displayed on a map, and selecting one of them will show you the average personality profile for that venue. This allows you to compare yourself to all the other people who go to the same places as you</p><p>[gallery link=”file” orderby=””]</p><p>Meanwhile, we get a bunch of (anonymised) personality profiles that are linked to venues, so we can see if there are any correlations between places/categories of places and personality profiles. For instance, one of the things we may find is that the average personality profiles of “non-places” (those places frequented by everybody: the supermarket, the train station etc.) are different from the average personality profiles of “places” (the places visited by a subset of people: independent coffee shops, your local pub etc). We may also expect people with different visiting patterns to have different personalities. For instance, maybe I mainly check-in to pubs and bars on Foursquare, while someone else mainly checks in to shops. Is there a difference between the personality profiles of people who check into more pubs and people who mainly check in to shops?</p><p>Obviously we’ve only just started collecting data, but hopefully we’ll start to see some answers to some of these questions soon.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/phd/research/workdiary/2012/11/16/phd-post-mortem-the-summary.html>PhD Post-mortem - The Summary</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>November 16, 2012</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>I originally wrote a whole bunch of posts (6!) about my PhD, what went wrong, how I felt about it,  and so on. Then I read it all back and it was a bunch of hugely self-indulgent poorly written bollocks (what’s new?), so I decided not to publish it. Maybe sometime later I’ll get round to it, but for now, the tl-dr; is:</p><p><strong>My viva was a car crash, my examiners hated my work, I got too depressed over the result to engage with the corrections process, had another viva, it was terrible but not as bad, I pulled it together and corrected it all in the end, thanks to some excellent support from everyone else.</strong></p><p>This summary that I’d also written might be useful to others in the same or similar position however, so I figure it’s worth putting online.</p><p>So, what have we learned from the car crash that was my PhD?</p><ol><li><p><strong>Make sure you pick the right examiners. </strong>My examiners were heavy-weight examiners, both of whom had a very similar statistical view on things. Let’s get it straight up front: they were right about my thesis in the first viva. It was definitely poor to average, and now it’s good. But other examiners would probably have passed it first time, or at least not have been quite as negative about the whole situation. The fact that they were both external and both didn’t like it basically caused a negative feedback loop, which ended very badly for me. I originally thought that had my supervisor chosen better, I would have passed earlier and that would have been good. But actually, having harsh examiners has done me a favour. Firstly, I’ve survived this entire process intact, going from crushing disappointment to ultimate success and that’s made me a much stronger person. But also, as I’ve said, they were right about my thesis. My thesis is far better now than it was when it was first submitted, and is something I can now be rightly proud of. It stood up to harsher scrutiny than most theses are subjected to, and came out well in the end. Had you asked me 16 months ago whether we’d picked the right examiners, I would have said ‘No’. Ask me now, and I’d probably still say ‘No’. But I’d take one of them. A harsher scrutiny leads to a better thesis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Progress monitoring does not work. </strong>I passed every single yearly review during my PhD. I attended and participated in every single poster session and research retreat during my PhD (when I wasn’t up in Edinburgh). I even won best presentation on two separate occasions. At no point did anyone in the school pick up on the problems that my examiners felt were major enough to prevent me passing. Not one member of my yearly review panel. Not my supervisor. Not any of the audience or staff members I talked to during progress review events. In my case, progress monitoring was useless. Yes, it will catch those people who are failing anyway and clearly haven’t done enough work, but my case, the case of the person who is doing the work but has just missed something, can slip through the cracks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Get a second opinion. </strong>Would another set of eyes reading my thesis have caught the problems? Possibly. I lost contact with my second supervisor after a couple of years (one of the perils of having a supervisor in a different academic school when the cross-discipline project you’re working on falls apart). Had I had another, maybe they would have caught some of the more minor things which the examiners caught. Fewer minor errors or problems may have decreased some of the negativity of the examiners. Interestingly, I did get a couple of friends to read it (just proof reading for typo’s etc) and one of them did make a point that was similar to the examiners major problem with the work. If only I’d listened…</p></li><li><p><strong>A bad viva outcome is not the end of the world. </strong>It’s devastating, but you can get through it. And basically, the easiest way to do it is to do the exact opposite of what I did. Engage with your examiners. Get them to clarify corrections. Send them drafts of things. Communicate with them. Ultimately, they don’t want to fail you, it causes too much paperwork. Had I done this, I would have been done far sooner. Ultimately in total I spent about a month and a half working full-time to correct everything, from after the first viva to final acceptance. Had I engaged with the examiners that would have been a month’s full-time work. I could have proven them wrong, shown them their decision was wrong, but I ignored it, ran away, and caused myself more problems than I needed to.</p></li><li><p><strong>It’s totally worth it. </strong>My thesis is now safe in the university digital repository, and I’ll get my PhD rubber stamped at the next awards committee. That is amazing. When I got the email about having passed, I was leaving work for a run. I ran down to the bay, out onto the barrage to meet Lisa from work, and sat staring out at the sea. It was over at long last. I worked harder for it, and I suffered more to get there, and that makes it all the sweeter.</p></li></ol></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/phd/research/2012/11/05/7-years-1-month-and-4-days-later.html>7 years, 1 month and 4 days later...</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>November 5, 2012</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>This is a post I’ve been waiting to write for a very long time. A very, very, long time. As I’ve been waiting so long I’m going to start with the good news: on the 30th October 2012 I finally received confirmation that my examiners had accepted my PhD corrections and I should be approved for my degree. I’m Dr Martin Chorley.</p><p>Exactly how long I’ve been waiting to write this depends on your point of view. I’ve definitely been waiting eagerly for 1 month and 2 days, pretty certain that this day was coming. I’ve been waiting pretty expectantly for 3 months and 21 days, fairly sure that the day is coming soon. I’ve been <em>really desperate</em> to be able to write this for 1 year, 6 months and 10 days, unsure whether I’d ever be able to. But ultimately, I guess as it’s been exactly 7 years, 1 month and 4 days since I started my PhD, I’ve been waiting for this moment for at least that long (even though I wasn’t blogging back then, and certainly didn’t expect to be writing a bunch of posts like these!).</p><p>So, why did it take so long, and why was I waiting for so many different lengths of time? It’s a long story, so I’ll split it over several posts, but the basic facts are that I did badly, tried to fix it, didn’t fix it well enough, so had to fix it again. It’s finally done now, and I can move on with all the rest of the stuff I’ve got to do.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/coding/home/music/2012/10/04/swn-artist-explorer.html>SWN Artist Explorer</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>October 4, 2012</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>It’s that time of year again: <a href=http://swnfest.com/ >SWN Festival</a> is once more upon us.

This uses tags from <a href=www.last.fm>Last.FM</a> and generates word clouds using a nice <a href=https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud>javascript plugin</a> for <a href=http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ >d3</a> written by <a href=http://www.jasondavies.com/ >Jason Davies</a>. Most of the word cloud js was hacked together from Jason’s <a href=http://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/ >example</a>, with some mangling and modification from me. I downloaded the tags for artists offline and stuck them in a .json file so it doesn’t hit the Last.FM servers on every page load. What we end up with is a fairly simple tag cloud example that allows you to see at a glance how Last.FM users have categorised the bands. Selecting a tag in the word cloud will show you the other bands in the lineup that have also had that tag applied to them.

Since then there have been other things occupying my time, (namely the battle of the thesis) but that’s almost over now, so my attention once again turns to getting some more teaching under my belt.</p><p>You get the feeling with some academics that teaching is seen as an annoyance - something that has to be done as part of the job but that is at best a distraction. I hate this attitude - if you can’t do something with passion then I feel you shouldn’t be doing it. Teaching is an opportunity to get people interested in things, to engage with them and make them think. Some people may argue that it’s just not possible to be passionate or engaging with their subject, but I would say that if that’s not possible, why are they teaching it?</p><p>I actively enjoy teaching, especially so when it’s on a topic I have a particular interest in. Recently Stu was good enough to ask me to give a guest lecture on Django in his first year Python module, and it was very enjoyable. I’ve been lucky enough to be asked to do something similar for Omer’s masters module this year, talking about Foursquare and its API initially, and then also presenting some things on Django a couple of weeks later. These are nice opportunities and allow me to talk at a semi-interested audience about topics that I like, which is always fun. Along with the guest lectures I’ve got planned, I’m also teaching LaTex to postgrad students from across the university as part of the University Graduate College, which will be a nice experience to teach a ‘programming language’ like topic to a bunch of people who probably aren’t computer scientists.</p><p>At the moment I’m also involved in scoping out some possible new modules for some courses that may (hopefully) happen here in the next year or so. This is the first time I’ve been able to look at a topic for a module and actually plan in detail what <em>I</em> think is important to teach, or what I would like to teach in such a module. It’s far more involved than I’ve been before, previously all the content and syllabus has been decided beforehand and I’ve had little scope to make many changes, so this is a novel experience. It requires a lot of thought to make sure that everything being planned is relevant, up to date, necessary and interesting.  Hopefully, I’m succeeding.</p></div></article><hr><div class=pagination><a href=/blog/page9 class=previous>Previous</a> <span class=page_number>Page: 10 of 20</span> <a href=/blog/page11 class=next>Next</a></div></div></body></html>
