Hello. I am Dr Martin Chorley.

I am a lecturer at the School of Computer Science & Informatics, Cardiff University.I'm programme leader for the [MSc in Computational Journalism](http://cardiff.ac.uk/jomec/degreeprogrammes/pgmasters/msc_computational_journalism/index.html), and also senior personal tutor for all taught postgraduate students. I mainly do work that falls under the umbrella of the [Mobile and Social Computing](http://mobisoc.cs.cf.ac.uk) "group", of which I am the coordinator. This site contains details of my [research](http://martinjc.com/research/), [publications](http://martinjc.com/research/publications/), [teaching](http://martinjc.com/teaching/) and also the semi-occasional rambling [blog post](http://martinjc.com/diary/).





I can be [contacted](http://martinjc.com/contact/) at m.j.chorley@cs.cardiff.ac.uk, or you can find me on many social networks, links below.
