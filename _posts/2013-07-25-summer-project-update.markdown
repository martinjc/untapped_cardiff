We are storming along with [summer projects](http://martinjc.com/research/student-projects/) now, and starting to see some really good results.

Liam Turner (who is starting a PhD in the school in October) has been working hard to create a mobile version of the [4SQPersonality](http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/recognition/foursqexp/) app. His work is coming along really well, with a great mobile HTML version now up and running, a native android wrapper working, and an iOS wrapper on its way. With any luck we'll have mobile apps for both major platforms ready to be released before the summer is over.

Max Chandler, who is now a second year undergraduate, has done some great work looking at the Foursquare venues within various cities around the UK, analysing them for similarity and spatial distribution. He's just over halfway through the project now and is beginning to work on visualising the data he's collected and analysed. He's creating some interesting interactive visualisations using [D3](http://d3js.org/), so as soon as he's done I'll link to the website here.

It's been a really good summer for student projects so far, with some really pleasing results. I'll post more description of the projects and share some of the results as they come to a close in the coming weeks.
