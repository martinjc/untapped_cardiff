So. 2013. That was an alright year. Finished the Recognition project, finally graduated, got a 12 month fellowship, started some interesting projects, and pushed on with the new MSc with JOMEC. Professionally, not too bad at all. Personally the year wasn't bad either, what with getting engaged and finally getting the house on the market.

But now it's a new year, so it's time to push things on further. My plans so far for this year seem to be 'smash it'. There's papers to be published, data to be analysed and project proposals to write (and get funded!). Getting a permanent job would be quite nice, while I'm at it. Here's to 2014 being even more successful than last year.
