Today was presentation day for me at [SCA 2013](http://socialcloud.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/confs/SCA2013/) - I was presenting the initial results of the [Foursquare experiment](http://martinjc.com/2012/11/20/foursquare-personality-experiment/), which has now been running for a while. The presentation seemed to go really well - I think it's the strongest work I've done yet, and so it was easy to talk well and with confidence about it, which led to a nice talk. There was also plenty of discussion after the talk, with a lot of good comments and questions from the audience, which suggests that most people were quite interested in the research. I pitched it as a WIP paper, describing what the ultimate aim of the project is - very much recycling the talk I gave to the interview panel for my [fellowship](http://martinjc.com/2013/08/16/epsrc-doctoral-award-fellowship/) proposal. I think it certainly got a few people interested who'll look to follow the project as it unfolds over the next couple of months.

After lunch there was an extra bonus when we discovered a beer vending machine in the hotel - what better way to celebrate a successful conference presentation than a cold beer in the sun?
