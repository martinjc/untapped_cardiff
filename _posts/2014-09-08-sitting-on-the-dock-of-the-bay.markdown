While we negotiate the transition from the old house which we've sold to the new house we've just bought we've been renting a lovely flat up on Penarth head. One of the main benefits of this flat is the glorious view over Cardiff Bay and to the city centre beyond. No matter what time it is, whenever I pass by the living room window I end up staring out across the city. During the day, there's boats coming and going through the barrage locks, or into the docks proper. At night the city is lit up with a terrible orange urban glow that somehow looks both peaceful and exciting. I've spent a lot of time just stood on the balcony watching, and it's been quite relaxing. Not only that, but I've had the opportunity to see some fairly interesting occurrences; especially when there's been an unusual visitor to Cardiff docks, such as this [tall ship](http://tallships.org/about-us/the-fleet/tall-ship/) we had visiting earlier in the year:

This was the case again this evening, when we were able to stand and watch the warships of various flags and types leaving Cardiff docks after the conclusion of the NATO summit in Newport. Leaving aside any particular feelings about militarisation, it is still genuinely interesting to see these things in your home city, even more so when you've got a good view.

Unfortunately despite still being up on the hill overlooking the city, the new house does not have such a commanding view of the docks, bay, or Cardiff. Losing that is one of the worst things about having to move. I guess I'll just have to get used to putting my shoes on and leaving the house whenever I want to stare out over the bay...
