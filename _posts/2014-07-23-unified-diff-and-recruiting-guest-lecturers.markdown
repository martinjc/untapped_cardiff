Last week I gave a quick lightning talk at [UnifiedDiff](http://unifieddiff.co.uk/) - a local tech [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/unified-diff) here in Cardiff. The main point of the talk was to try and recruit more industry involvement for our new [MSc in Computational Journalism](http://courses.cardiff.ac.uk/postgraduate/course/detail/p411.html) - preferably by getting some web developers and software engineers in to give guest lectures on the tools, languages and processes they use.

The talk went well, and I've had several offers from people wanting to get involved and add some real value to the course, which is brilliant. Of course, there's always room to add more, so if you're interested in coming and talking to our students, [get in touch](http://martinjc.com/contact/)!

If you're interested, the slides from the talk are [here](http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Unified-Diff-Giving-up-your-time-for-money-and-satisfaction.pdf)
