Over the summer, Ian and I are going to be supervising a summer project. We're going to get a 2nd year undergraduate student for an 8 week project. I've stuck up a page about it [here](http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/M.J.Chorley/research/augmented-conversation/), and will post whenever there's something interesting to see.
